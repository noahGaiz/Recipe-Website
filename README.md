# Recipe-Website

I made this in November of 2023.
This is the first project I completed. This project was made to practice my web development skills and using them. I decided to make a recipe website as I wasnt a fan of cooking. The whole obejct of the recipe website was to show how to cook a burger, but the whole point of the website was to practice using html,css and js. I started out by creating my files that I was going to use and started adding html to them. I learnt many different tags that webite use like header and footer and learning text size tags like h1 and h2. After I went to bootstrap and w3 schools to find premade objects on websites already.This is was very useful for me as these websites are still very helpful for me now.After filling out the html in my pages,I started creating css for my pages adding design to them. W3 schools was especially helpful for learning how to design different asepcts of the website. After adding some css to the website all I had left to explore was javascript so I had a couple small functions in javascript in the website to give it more life.

This project was very beneficial for my learning as I learned the basics of html,css and js and helped me learn how to structure a website for the future.

If I were to do this project again I would definitely try add more javascript to the project and experiment a bit more.
